# CropCare AI – Smart Crop Disease Diagnosis for Indian Farmers

## Problem
Farmers often struggle to identify crop diseases at an early stage.  
Limited access to agricultural experts and delayed diagnosis leads to
crop loss, reduced yield, and financial stress—especially for small-scale
Indian farmers.

## Solution
CropCare AI is a smart crop disease diagnosis and advisory platform that
uses image-based machine learning to detect crop diseases and provide
actionable treatment suggestions.

Farmers can upload an image of an affected crop leaf, and the system
predicts the disease and suggests preventive or corrective actions.

## Key Features
- Image-based crop disease detection
- AI-powered disease classification
- Simple and farmer-friendly interface
- Advisory suggestions for treatment and prevention

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Machine Learning (Image Classification)
- React (Frontend)
- Flask / FastAPI (Backend – prototype)

## Challenges
- Handling real-world noisy images
- Dataset imbalance across disease classes
- Improving model accuracy for similar-looking diseases

## Results
- Successfully trained a crop disease classification model
- Built an end-to-end prototype from model training to UI
- Achieved reliable predictions on test images

## What I Learned
- Complete ML pipeline: data preprocessing → training → evaluation
- Bridging AI models with real-world problems
- Designing technology with a strong social impact
