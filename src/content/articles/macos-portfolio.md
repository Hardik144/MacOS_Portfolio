# Designing a macOS-Style Portfolio Using React & GSAP

## Motivation
Traditional developer portfolios often feel static and generic.
I wanted to build something interactive and memorable—something that
reflects both my frontend skills and my attention to user experience.

Inspired by macOS UI, I decided to design a portfolio that feels like a
desktop environment rather than a standard website.

## Approach
The portfolio mimics macOS elements such as windows, smooth animations,
and minimal aesthetics while still being fully responsive and web-friendly.

Each section behaves like a native app panel, making navigation intuitive
and engaging.

## Key Features
- macOS-inspired UI layout
- Smooth animations using GSAP
- Modular React components
- Article / Case Study system using internal routes
- Clean, distraction-free design

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- GSAP (Animations)
- CSS / Tailwind
- React Router

## Challenges
- Managing animations without hurting performance
- Designing reusable UI components
- Maintaining accessibility while using animations

## Outcome
- A unique, standout portfolio experience
- Improved understanding of UI/UX principles
- Stronger frontend architecture skills

## What I Learned
- Animation-driven UI design
- Component-based thinking in React
- Building products that focus on user experience, not just visuals
