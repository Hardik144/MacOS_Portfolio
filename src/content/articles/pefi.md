# Product Eco-Friendliness Index (PEFI)

## Problem
Consumers want to make environmentally responsible choices, but product
labels and claims are often unclear, inconsistent, or misleading.

There is no simple, standardized way to measure and compare how
eco-friendly a product truly is.

## Solution
The Product Eco-Friendliness Index (PEFI) is a machine-learning based
scoring system that evaluates products on sustainability-related factors
and assigns a normalized eco-friendliness score.

The index helps users compare products objectively instead of relying
only on marketing claims.

## Core Idea
PEFI combines multiple environmental parameters into a single score that
represents the overall sustainability impact of a product.

## Features
- Eco-friendliness scoring system
- Data-driven sustainability assessment
- Comparable product rankings
- Explainable scoring logic

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Visualization tools

## Challenges
- Selecting meaningful sustainability features
- Normalizing diverse environmental metrics
- Making the score interpretable and transparent

## Results
- Built a functional sustainability scoring model
- Successfully translated real-world environmental factors into ML features
- Demonstrated how ML can support responsible consumer decisions

## What I Learned
- Applying ML beyond traditional prediction tasks
- Feature engineering for real-world impact problems
- Designing ethical and explainable AI systems
